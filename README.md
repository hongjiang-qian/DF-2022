### Deep filtering: A new computational approach

nn_DF.py - main script to build neural network with adaptive learning rate, refer to xxx.

Ex1_generator.py - generate Monte Carlo samples for the specific mode and store data with gzip.
Ex1_loader.py - load data

(same with Ex2_generator.py, Ex2_loader.py; Ex3_generator.py, Ex3_loader.py; Ex4_generator.py, Ex4_loader.py)
