### Deep filtering: A new computational approach

nn_DF.py - main script to build neural network with adaptive learning rate which is adapted from https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

Exi_generator.py - generate Monte Carlo samples for the specific mode and store data with gzip (i=1,2,3,4).

Exi_loader.py - load data (i=1,2,3,4).

Exi.ipynb - python code in Jupyter notebook to train the neural network and produce results.

datas - data generated from Exi_generator.py (i=1,2,3,4) for each example.

img - images stored from Exi.ipynb.
